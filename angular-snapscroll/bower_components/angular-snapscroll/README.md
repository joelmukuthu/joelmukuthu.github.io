# angular-snapscroll

Snapscroll is an [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) directive that provides scroll-and-snap functionality, similar to [fullPage.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/). This only works for vertical scrolling though.

- JS-only implementation
- Only requires angular core
- 5.5kB when minified, 2.0kB when gzipped

### Demo

### Installation

Install with bower:
```sh
bower install angular-snapscroll
# or
bower install joelmukuthu/angular-snapscroll
```
And link to the main JS file:
```html
<script src="/bower_components/snapscroll/dist/snapscroll.js"></script>
```
Or download/clone this repo then link to the main JS file.

### Usage
Include the snapscroll module as a dependency in your app:
```javascript
angular.module('myapp', ['snapscroll']);
```

And add `snapscroll` as an attribute to any element to make it snap-scrollable! The element would have a scrollbar to begin with, the idea being that with the `snapscroll` attribute you're adding scroll-and-snap behaviour to an element that is otherwise scrollable:
```html
<div style="height: 200px;" snapscroll="">
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
</div>
```
All you need to set is the height of the element and the directive will take care of the rest. However, to have the element fill the browser viewport:
```html
<div snapscroll="" fit-window-height="">
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
</div>
```

#### scroll service

The module also provides a minimalistic `scroll` service that can be used to animate `scrollTop`, see the [docs](DOCS.md) for more info.

### Documentation

For more examples, check out the [demo site] and for all the configuration options, have a look at the [docs](DOCS.md).

### Contributing

Snapscroll uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for fast development and testing. To set up your working environment, download the repo and run:
```sh
npm install && bower install
```

Then to continuously watch files and run tests as you code:
```sh 
grunt
```

Check out the Gruntfile for more grunt tasks (test, build etc).

### Todo's

- snapscroll as an element - would allow use of templates and ngAnimate for animations. Currently this repo has a (rather outdated) 'as-element' branch for this.
- more browser tests
